### Project Overview

 Predicted the price of Lego collector set by identifying various independent variables present in dataset. Prediction is done using Linear Regression Method. Dropping the columns present in data set where the correlation between independent variables are is highly positive, since these variables impact the model and prediction. Once the prediction is done, calculated RMSE, MSE and R2 values to check the accuracy of the model.
